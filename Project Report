What types of data sets did you construct?

	-We constructed data sets from 1..x where x is an integer ranging from 100 to 1000000
	-We used these data sets in tests that performed between 100 and 100000 inserts
	-These tests include:
		//INSERT
		// - Increasing order without repeats
		// - Increasing order with repeats
		// - Decreasing order without repeats
		// - Decreasing order with repeats
		// - Clustered values
		// - Random
		//
		//SEARCH
		// - Get number of comparisons used in search
		//     for ~every~ number in data set

Did you compare different ways of extending the Skip list?

What did you discover about the height of the skip list?
	
	-At least in our tests, the height of our skiplist was on average 1 or 2 elements higher than the expected height of log(n)
	-This discrepency was higher with more inserts
	-We visually graph our tree with periods, with the advantage that everything is formatted correctly and the disadvantage that we can't see more information about the elements (ie. their value)
